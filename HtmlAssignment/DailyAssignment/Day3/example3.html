<h2><u>Basketball</u></h2>
<p>Basketball is a limited contact sport played on a rectangular court. While most often played as a team sport with five players on each side, three-on-three, two-on-two, and one-on-one competitions are also common. The objective is to shoot a ball through a hoop 18 inches (46 cm) in diameter and 10 feet (3.048 m) high that is mounted to a backboard at each end of the court. The game was invented in 1891 by Dr. James Naismith.</p>
<pre class=para>A team can score a field goal by shooting the ball through the basket being defended by the opposition team during regular play. 
A field goal scores three points for the shooting team if the player shoots from behind the three-point line, and two points 
if shot from in front of the line</pre>
